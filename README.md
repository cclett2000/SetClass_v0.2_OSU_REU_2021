# SetClass_v0.2_OSU_REU_2021
Project I worked on over the summer with Oklahoma State University's Research for Undergraduates (REU) Program

The algorithm this implements is based on Dr. Charu C. Aggarwal's Setwise Stream Classification Problem

The main goal of this project was to learn some basics about machine learning (classification in particular) and to implement Dr. Aggarwal's algorithm using a dataset collected from a real-world healthcare study to evaluate the proposed algorithm and to see what improvements could be made in the future. This alogrithm is a new approach to classifying data using machine learning (classification) with datasets composed of multiple subsets of data, allowing for a more accurate classification compared to density based classification. The algorithm also works in realtime, however, my implementation not in realtime given that the dataset I used was already collected and stored.
